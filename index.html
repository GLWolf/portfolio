                <p> My very first experience with tech was when my Gameboy wouldn’t work so I open it up to see why. I
                    was fascinated by the way looked and curious about how it worked. Later on in life I met my
                    girlfriend, she inspired me to learn more about software and coding in general, watching her work on
                    projects was what got me interested in coding. Seeing how code can turn into incredible and useful
                    websites still makes me excited and ready to learn more. I always loved building things from Legos
                    to models, and because I have an overactive imagination I come up with some interesting designs.
                    Unfortunately, very bad stick figures are the extent of my skills in art. However, with coding I
                    can make the most of my ideas, and they come to life on the screen.</p>
                                   </br>   
                <p> I am a first-generation American and the youngest in my family. My dad is from the Portuguese
                    islands and my mom is from Brazil. I grew up in a dinky town in central California that was heavy in
                    agriculture and from a young age, I knew the definition of hard work. There’s nothing like pouring
                    concrete in 100-degree weather. I know how difficult it can be to learn a new language, but I also
                    know how rewarding it can be to master it. I’m excited to work in a team of peers to imagine,
                    discover, and create apps and websites.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This app will test your knowledge of the green lantern comics. It’s a 10 question quiz that uses
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. This is a fun app to play with and test your knowledge. I plan on
                    updating a few futures and adding audio files to the quiz, which will read the questions and answers
                    to you also give a brief history for each question. </p>
                <h2>Hurdles</h2>
                <p>Most of the hurdles I face during this project were typos and syntax errors. Coding at 3 am is not
                    the best idea. Another challenge I faced was getting the styling for the text and the background to
                    work together. I have already started on the audio function and it has been challenging and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>I learned a lot during my time building this app. Creating listeners that would iterate to the
                    correct question and bring up the correct answers. I am learning to add audio files and will add
                    them to the app. Also being careful about what I type is another important lesson I learned from this
                    app.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This app will helps find sales for pc games. It will give you the normal price, the sale price, a link 
                    to Metacritic, and the website were the sales at. If you search for a game that you know is a pc game 
                    and it does not show up it’s because the game is not on sale.</p>
                <h2>Hurdles</h2>
                <p>One challenge I faced during this project was that API website only works on Internet Explorer and it was
                    not clear how to use the information. A lot of trial and error. Another issue I had was with styling the 
                    image that appeared for the game. Most images were not the same size with a few being tiny and others being 
                    huge.</p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>I learned a lot about problem solving, especially with working on two different APIs and having them work 
                    cohesively together. I also got better grasp of creative styling. For example, if you’re on the landing page 
                    and hover over the links that show under the store list of sale, a small image of the game will appear.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>WorkOutWF is an app that help to connect with others with a similar workout schedule. You can create a profile 
                    add in a day and general time that you are available to work out. After you can search by day and available times 
                    and find other users with that availability.</p>
                <h2>Hurdles</h2>
                <p>One big obstacle that I overcame on this project was how to get the user to search for other user by the date and 
                    time. A user updating their profile was easy, but grabbing the data was difficult. Since I only wanted some of the 
                    data, not the user’s entire list. I created a dropdown search so the user picks from a list search occurs it only 
                    grabs the requested data.</p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>I learned that it is better work on the basics of the app first, and not to get lost in all the add-ons features that
                    you want to add.</p>

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>WTDD enables users to create visual representations of data from their csv files. Users will be able to graph x y coordinates,
                    and representing them visually as bar, line, and scatter plot graphs. Make it easy for students/non-technical people to make 
                    graphs and charts.</p>
                <h2>Hurdles</h2>
                <p>Working on a team was a great experience, but something I had to learn quickly was to learn how others like to wright code. 
                    One amazing thing about coding is that there’s many ways to tackle a problem and create a solution. So I had to learn how each 
                    member on my team wrote their code so if I had to fix a bug or add a functionality I was not lost on where to start.</p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>Working with github and creating multiple branches pushing, pulling, and merging was a headache at first. It took some trial 
                    and error to understand how to successfully merge branches with only a few conflicts. I truly loved working with a team and 
                    learning from each member.  </p>
