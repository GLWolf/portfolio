                <p>     I grew up in a small town in central California. I am the youngest in my family and also the
                    first-generation American. My dad is from the Portuguese islands and my mom is from Brazil. The town
                    I grew up in was heavy in agriculture and from a young age, I knew the definition of hard work.
                    Nothing like pouring concrete in 100-degree weather. My first experience with tech was when my
                    Gameboy wouldn’t work so I open it up to see why. I was amazed to see how it look and curious about
                    how it worked.
                                       </br>
                                       </br>
                        Later in life, I meet my girlfriend and she was my inspiration into understanding the software of
                    how things work. She is a developer and watching her work on projects got me interested in coding.
                    Seeing how strings of code turn into cool and amazing websites fascinated me. I always loved
                    building things from Legos to buildings, and I always halved an amazing imagination to come up with
                    cool designs. It sucks that the best I was able to do with my imagination was very bad stick
                    figures. But with codding, I can make most of my ideas come to life. I know how hard it is to learn
                    a new language and I know how rewarding it can be to master it. I’m excited to work in a team of
                    peers to imagine, discover, and create apps and websites.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This app will test your knowledge of the green lantern comics. It’s a 10 question quiz that uses
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. This is a fun app to play with and test your knowledge. I plan on
                    updating a few futures and adding audio files to the quiz. This will read the questions and answers
                    to you also give a brief history to each question. </p>
                <h2>Hurdles</h2>
                <p>Most of the hurdles I face during this project were typos and syntax errors. Coding at 3 am, not the
                    best idea. I have to come up with ways for the text and the background to get along and not make it
                    hard to read. I have already started on the audio function and it has been challenging and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>I learned a lot during my time building this app. Creating listeners that would iterate to the right
                    question and bring up the right answers. Learning to add audio files and adding them to the app.
                    Have not updated the master branch still working on the kinks.</p>
