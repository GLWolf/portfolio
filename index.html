                <p> My very first experience with tech was when my Gameboy wouldn’t work so I open it up to see why. I
                    was fascinated by the way looked and curious about how it worked. Later on in life I met my
                    girlfriend, she inspired me to learn more about software and coding in general, watching her work on
                    projects was what got me interested in coding. Seeing how code can turn into incredible and useful
                    websites still makes me excited and ready to learn more. I always loved building things from Legos
                    to models, and because I have an overactive imagination I come up with some interesting designs.
                    Unfortunately, very bad stick figures are the extent of my skills in art. However, with codding I
                    can make the most of my ideas, and they come to life on the screen.</p>
                                   </br>   
                <p> I am a first-generation American and the youngest in my family. My dad is from the Portuguese
                    islands and my mom is from Brazil. I grew up in a dinky town in central California that was heavy in
                    agriculture and from a young age, I knew the definition of hard work. There’s nothing like pouring
                    concrete in 100-degree weather. I know how difficult it can be to learn a new language, but I also
                    know how rewarding it can be to master it. I’m excited to work in a team of peers to imagine,
                    discover, and create apps and websites.

                <h2>Description</h2>
                <p>This app will test your knowledge of the green lantern comics. It’s a 10 question quiz that uses
                    HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JQuery. This is a fun app to play with and test your knowledge. I plan on
                    updating a few futures and adding audio files to the quiz, which will read the questions and answers
                    to you also give a brief history for each question. </p>
                <h2>Hurdles</h2>
                <p>Most of the hurdles I face during this project were typos and syntax errors. Coding at 3 am is not
                    the best idea. Another challenge I faced was getting the styling for the text and the background to
                    work together. I have already started on the audio function and it has been challenging and fun.
                </p>
                <h2>What I learned</h2>
                <p>I learned a lot during my time building this app. Creating listeners that would iterate to the
                    correct question and bring up the correct answers. I am learning to add audio files and will add
                    them to the app. Also being careful about what I type is another important lesson I learned from this
                    app.</p>
